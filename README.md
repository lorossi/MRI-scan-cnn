# MRI SCAN CNN

This is an attempt at creating a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify MRI scans of the brain as either normal or abnormal. The dataset used is the Brain MRI Images for Brain Tumor Detection dataset from Kaggle. The dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection).
